## Abstract
This is a birth control tool for women who follow the fertility awareness method (natural birth control).  A user logging in for the first time is prompted to submit the profile form, so the app can start tracking their high risk and low risk days.  Once their profile information has been logged, a user can start tracking their daily basal body temperature along with any symptoms they might be having that day.  After filling out today's entry, a user can then view whether today is a high risk day or not.  The user can also see their historical data through a color coded calendar, or she can view reports that will display her temperature over the past 7 or 30 days. 
## Learning Goals
* Build a PWA
* Utilize TypeScript and React Hooks
* Implement TravisCI
* Deploy to Heroku

```
## In Action

## Wins
- 


- Writing a very atomic project board from the beginning, and staying on task with our due dates to finish the project on time
- Gaining more practice with SCSS, accessibility installments, network requests, spy testing, and iterator prototypes
- Long, effective pairing hours remotely
## Future Iterations..
- Connect the daily entry form to a bluetooth thermometer, so a user's daily entry is automatically captured.
- Predict a user's high risk days
## Technologies Used
- React, React Hooks
- TypeScript
- Jest
- React Testing Library
- HTML/SCSS
- npm
  - react-chartjs-2
  - react-multi-select-component
  - react-calendar
  - moment
## Systems/Practices
- git/Version Control
- TravisCI
- Heroku
- PR Template
- Project Board
- TDD
